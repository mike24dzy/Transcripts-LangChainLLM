106
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:34.390
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah, so to kick things off justin you, you don't look particularly Japanese, but you've worked in in Japan, for I think a the bulk of, or a lot of your your career. How did you decide to

107
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.520
Daniel Tedesco: learn Japanese and build a career in Japan.

108
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:46.880
Justin: Well, yeah, I you did get me. I'm not originally from Japan. I grew up in the Us. A. I actually

109
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.060
Justin: found my way to Japan sort of by accident. I was part of a

110
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.770
Justin: when I was, I believe, 16 years old. When I was in high school. I was so

111
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:05.980
Justin: invited to be on a U.S.A. wrestling team that toured Japan. I was wrestling all through my

112
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:16.460
Justin: schooling years all the way through University, and so I was asked to to come here, and this is in the mid eighties, I think 1,986 around that time.

113
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.920
Justin: and it was very much an eye-opener for me to come to such a what was for me a very foreign place, and

114
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.710
have no understanding of the culture or the language.

115
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:39.320
Justin: This is obviously pre Internet. So it was not as easy to access information on Japan prior to visiting, so

116
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:46.410
Justin: we spent the better part of 2 weeks touring the country and competing in Paris locations, and

117
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.570
Justin: really changed me. So

118
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.460
Justin: after the tour ended, I went back to the States.

119
00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:07.150
Justin: where I went to university and decided when I entered University I would try my hand at Japanese. and ultimately majored in East Asian studies.

120
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:23.270
Justin: 10 to the my junior year in Japan. I had a strong desire to live in Japan and see how much of the language I could learn. So my junior year I studied abroad in Kyoto.

121
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:32.770
Justin: and so it just sort of it's one of those random things that you know snowballed over time and became more and more of my passion and

122
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.410
Justin: and the focus of my studies, and ultimately my career thereafter.

123
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.810
Daniel Tedesco: Wow! And that that's

124
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.570
Daniel Tedesco: the the first introduction I've heard to Japanese culture via via wrestling.

125
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.760
Justin: Yeah, I think it's pretty random.

126
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.590
Daniel Tedesco: but but a a pretty cool starting point.

127
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.230
Daniel Tedesco: One of the things I I've noticed about.

128
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.750
Daniel Tedesco: I guess the bulk of people who.

129
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:17.410
Daniel Tedesco: you know, maybe learn a a another language in college or in high school, and go to a different country from where they grew up and and stay for a while. They

130
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:27.760
Daniel Tedesco: most people, tend to go back to their home country. But you, you decided to kind of build an international career.

131
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:38.160
Daniel Tedesco: You know. How how did you decide to do that, and what what we're kind of the the the challenges that that you face doing so? And how did you overcome that?

132
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:47.170
Justin: Well, it was when I first graduated university. My plan was to come back to Japan and work for a period of time. I think I set

133
00:14:47.480 --> 00:15:03.730
Justin: the parameters of 3 to 5 years, and then set up, and then i'll go get my mba, and move back to the States. But what I found was after that 5 years had passed. I actually took my G. Mats and was a scheduled to go to a

134
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.760
Justin: business school. I even had the the business school

135
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:17.440
Justin: lined up and was planning to move to London, actually to go to business school, and an opportunity just presented itself to

136
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:25.110
Justin: change jobs and join an Internet startup in 1996. So i'm dating myself

137
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.380
Justin: dial up days

138
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:34.330
Justin: a fixed line. Only it was brutal, but at the time time it was revolutionary. And so

139
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.110
Justin: a friend of mine, a Japanese man, started a a business right in my neighborhood, and

140
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:48.980
Justin: invited me to to join and get in early, and that proves for me to be the ultimate business school. I I

141
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.080
Justin: learning you, learn fast when you you have

142
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.050
Justin: severe cash, flow pressure.

143
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.290
Justin: You. You learn how to do business development sales, you learn how to to

144
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.050
Justin: to

145
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.940
it.

146
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:12.440
Justin: fast track your product development. You learn how to manage teams and motivate teams out of necessity.

147
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:23.120
Justin: You You learn a lot of things that way, so I ultimately didn't go to business school. I went into the start up instead, and it and it kept me in Japan

148
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:34.460
Justin: in Asia. I did a couple of years in Singapore, setting us up a subsidiary of our startup in sample. But ultimately that opportunity and migrating my career to the Internet

149
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.000
Justin: kept me in Japan. And

150
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.190
at that point I just decided more to commit to the long haul.

151
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.430
Daniel Tedesco: Wow!

152
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.370
Daniel Tedesco: And that that was, I guess, a a Japanese company, right?

153
00:16:53.130 --> 00:17:03.510
Daniel Tedesco: But I I guess international operations. And you've also spent a lot of time working for international companies in Japan. So you've had to.

154
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.810
Daniel Tedesco: You know, through that process, I imagine, build a lot of trust across different cultures

155
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:21.619
Daniel Tedesco: over time, like what has been your approach to doing that? You know, building trust between local teams and a overseas headquarter

156
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:30.620
Daniel Tedesco: and also building trust with local teams when you know you're not from the country where you know most of the people on your team are from

157
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.710
Justin: right right? Well, there's there's a lot of challenges there, You know, when I first started my career I was in a very large Japanese company, and

158
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:51.430
Justin: when I go on business trips to other regions, V. It North America or South East Asia, you would hear gripes about the headquarters, and how the headquarters doesn't get it, and then

159
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.310
Justin: fast forward a decade, and i'm an executive in Disney, Japan, and

160
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:07.150
Justin: and we would have our gripes about headquarters, and how they don't, and that is just a an understandable, very human way of.

161
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:18.510
Justin: you know, seeing sort of the Hq. Versus subsidiary relationship. And when you're working cross border it is challenging to

162
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.230
Justin: build trust, even in a common language, because

163
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:34.420
Justin: you know, without that face to face relationship, it's it's not easy. And then couple of that with time zones and language barriers and obviously significant cultural differences.

164
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:41.880
Justin: These are non-trivial things. When you're building and leading teams to factor in and to

165
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:49.310
Justin: to over time, build build and a a a skill set for of managing, and and you know, I think

166
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.910
Justin: I I I can only speak in general terms, which is, I think.

167
00:18:53.970 --> 00:19:04.500
Justin: you know, what makes a great leader is pretty consistent. and much of you know, regardless of culture and much of what informs my

168
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.730
Justin: perception of a good leader was informed, or my my 17 years in Disney, because

169
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:24.790
Justin: I had a lot of exceptional bosses and received a lot of exposure to excellent people across all disciplines. And so my view on leadership is that, you know, in general

170
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.220
Justin: the leader works for the team. The leader works for the partners.

171
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.150
The leader works for the customers and not the other way around.

172
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.020
Justin: And so, if you're a leader.

173
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.310
Justin: you I think you're doing yourself a favor. If you

174
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:58.030
Justin: regardless of what country you're in seeing your role is to to take care of the people in your organization. First and foremost, your role is, Take care of your customers, and your role is to take care of your business partners. Sometimes you need to

175
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:02.150
Justin: represent your business partner's interests back to the headquarters.

176
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:15.040
Justin: or or to your boss, who may have a differing opinion from what you believe, and is in the best interest of the partnership, and so being a leader, is, is complicated. But I think

177
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.340
Justin: there's several sort of key things that you can

178
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.960
Justin: at least that igling from my experience that are important and have helped me in Japan. One is

179
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:33.880
Justin: is being very curious about individual team members, needs and business partners needs.

180
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:40.130
Justin: So that means when you're when you're doing one on ones or having dinners with your partners

181
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.550
Justin: asking a lot of questions and and trying to get at what's

182
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.300
Justin: their motivation, and how

183
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:59.150
Justin: I can, as a leader, maximize their talent if I get the most out of them, and and unlock their ambition and their sort of

184
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.150
Justin: passion for what they do. It's going to help me

185
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.210
Justin: asking a lot of questions to better understand them

186
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.040
Justin: as necessary, coach them, support them.

187
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.750
and and obviously learn from them. So I I try to do that quite a bit.

188
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:25.190
Justin: because ultimately it makes me a better leader, and it, you know, pragmatically speaking, and increases my probability for success. So I think being curious is really really important.

189
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:40.030
Justin: and and the other word that again I picked up very much when I was at Disney. That is used quite a bit as thoughtfulness. and I think in most Asian cultures. Thoughtfulness is taken to a higher level, you know.

190
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.740
Justin: paying attention. It's certainly in Japan it is, and you, you know.

191
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.070
Justin: paying attention to detail, and that that includes, you know.

192
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:59.160
Justin: expressions on a team members face or or their posture in a meeting or an off the cuff, remark that they make that may have some deeper meaning.

193
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.050
Justin: because things are not always so

194
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:07.340
Justin: bluntly or directly stated in this culture as as it is in some other cultures. And so.

195
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.640
Justin: being very thoughtful to follow up with people and ask them

196
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:22.310
Justin: how things are going, but also following up with them to to complement them when they've done a good job and let them know

197
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:29.400
Justin: that you see what they're doing, and that what they're doing matters. And again.

198
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:38.420
Justin: ultimately, a motivated workforce is a very powerful thing, and and you know, as the leader need to be very good at unlocking that. And

199
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:54.440
Justin: and again, then you represent their needs into the headquarters cross border, and that, too, needs to be a constructive relationship. So you do need to get on a plane and go to headquarters and spend time with folks and understand their motivations and headquarters.

200
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.690
Justin: and be about balanced. Representative of the company's needs back into your team

201
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:06.910
Justin: so it it. It cannot be an antagonistic relationship. It has to be like a

202
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.560
something where you're, you know, seeing both sides.

203
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.320
Justin: and really trying to always work towards a a, a sort of common direction.

204
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:24.570
Justin: a forward pass forward that people are comfortable with. And I think when you talk about like us to Asia

205
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.890
Justin: us to Japan, there's always ample

206
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:33.680
Justin: risk that things will get misunderstood or not properly communicated. So you really need to work hard.

207
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:42.000
Justin: Be thoughtful about the details, and following up with people. I think that's always my case. It's served me well to to work that way.

208
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.550
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah, a lot of great insights there.

209
00:23:46.750 --> 00:24:06.390
Daniel Tedesco: I think that the one specific one that that you pointed out that maybe isn't as obvious to people. I I guess our audience is mostly English speakers who Haven't worked in Asian cultures before, particularly East Asian cultures is the kind of level of in in directness

210
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.440
Daniel Tedesco: that you know is if

211
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.580
Daniel Tedesco: if Americans don't like something you'll hear about it

212
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:35.470
Daniel Tedesco: pretty directly and often quickly, but a lot of times in East Asian cultures, you know. You mentioned like a kind of an off the cuff remark, or or something said, you know, in in context of a bunch of other things in a in a meeting might actually have

213
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:41.140
Daniel Tedesco: a a deeper meaning, and it's not that anyone is trying to be indirect

214
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:55.640
Daniel Tedesco: or or or trying not to express themselves. It's just the way that people express their views to. Maybe their boss is different than you tend to see in in Western cultures.

215
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:03.090
Justin: Yeah, I mean it's it's it's obviously what you say is important, and how you say it is important.

216
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.060
Justin: And also where you say it

217
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.590
Justin: right. If you're in a meeting room with 8 other people

218
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:21.480
Justin: you have to in, and there's a particular team member you want to address in one another. You have to think about what you say in front of those other 7 members. How they will view what you say.

219
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.940
Justin: I had a boss and Disney a great boss, who.

220
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:32.420
Justin: when I first became a GM. He said to me, you need to realize that now you're always on stage.

221
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:42.560
Justin: and what he meant. What he meant by being on stage was that, whether you realize it or not, every comment you make is heard and interpreted by people

222
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:51.360
Justin: sometimes in ways you didn't intend. or you didn't realize. Maybe you're having a bad day, and you make a comment that you really didn't mean, or

223
00:25:51.520 --> 00:26:06.920
Justin: or if maybe you meant it, but it's not something that you would ordinary express ordinarily express. But you were tired, or you were in a bad mood, or you know you worried about your your kids grades, or whatever it was, and and you had a moment of weakness.

224
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.510
Justin: and you said something that you should not have. And then you

225
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.970
Justin: you spend the next 6 months trying to

226
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.120
Justin: unwind that.

227
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.600
Justin: And so, as a leader, you need to be very careful about

228
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:28.220
Justin: what you say, and I think particularly in in in my experience in Asian territories. That's particularly the case.

229
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:34.960
Justin: because one of the great strengths I think of of folks in the Us. Is that they're very direct.

230
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:45.150
Justin: very expressive, and and but when they say something, they don't necessarily mean or they regret later on. They're also pretty direct and open about

231
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.820
Justin: acknowledging that. And so.

232
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:59.730
Justin: which is, is a is a good quality, and I think that in in at least in Japan, where I have the most experience. I'm comfortable in saying that

233
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:07.610
Justin: it's harder to re unwind something once you've said it too. so you need to be careful about, you know.

234
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.240
making as few mistakes up front as you can.

235
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.430
Justin: It's not that people won't. Forgive you, but that

236
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:26.590
Justin: it's just it's just a little bit more subtle, I guess communication, and therefore harder to take things back

237
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:33.160
Justin: or minimize their impact after the fact. So you just need to be very thoughtful again to use that word

238
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:37.440
Justin: about what you say, how you say it and where you say it.

239
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.380
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah. Thinking about those 3

240
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.540
Daniel Tedesco: together. It makes a big difference.

241
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.610
Daniel Tedesco: I guess. Another thing that kind of came out in your comments is to some extent it sounds like

242
00:27:53.770 --> 00:28:04.260
Daniel Tedesco: it's. It's less about trying to optimize for specific cultures. There are, you know, rules of of kind, of

243
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.740
Daniel Tedesco: being a good leader that brings different groups with different interests together.

244
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.870
Daniel Tedesco: and

245
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:22.170
Daniel Tedesco: a lot of the culture stuff. Maybe i'm kind of projecting my own own views here, so you could share your comments in a minute. But a lot of the cultural stuff is is kind of a

246
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:32.650
Daniel Tedesco: a a veneer over top of general human things that are are going to be pretty

247
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.830
Daniel Tedesco: stable to to some extent

248
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.380
Daniel Tedesco: in in any environment. That's you know, bringing different people with different interests and backgrounds together.

249
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.280
Justin: I I think this is right, and in you

250
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:55.430
Justin: I've had the honor of managing people across Asia. Pacific. Right people, you know, everywhere from like

251
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:07.130
Justin: Thailand and and and Singapore and Taipei and Shanghai and Beijing and Seoul and you know, obviously Tokyo. And and so there are.

252
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:16.650
Justin: There are significant differences between folks, and it's not just language culture. It is is a driving fact of it. But I think underlying to that is

253
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.170
Justin: what is culturally agnostic is that people want to be treated with respect.

254
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:35.090
Justin: They respond when you show a genuine interest in curiosity and what they're doing, and who they are. And if you're thoughtful about how you engage with him and you represent their best interests.

255
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.470
Justin: They, these tenants are culturally agnostic.

256
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.470
Justin: Now I I I am a pretty vocal

257
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:52.430
Justin: in in my experiences in Disney and Sculpture. I've been pretty vocal throughout my career about. you know, hating the word global.

258
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.910
Justin: because I I think frankly, the work global is usually used.

259
00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:15.260
Justin: It's another way of seeing us export in in in. And you know, there, for for example, in the gaming industry, I don't think there's I don't think you can name for me 5, really, truly, maybe not even 3 truly global game companies.

260
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.250
Justin: There are no companies that I'm aware of, that really addresses

261
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:38.650
Justin: the different regions and cultures competitively, consistently. And there's a reason for that, and and the world is a very big place in a very complex place, and and i'm I've been fine with that for a very long time I've actually I prefer that, and enjoy that. I don't think that

262
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:49.610
Justin: all the world's all gravitating to the same thing. Now I think that's nonsense, but I do think, I think, underneath the human sort of key tenants of being treated with respect and

263
00:30:49.620 --> 00:31:01.180
Justin: and knowing that your boss cares about you, and is curious about what you're up to and wants to understand you and and is is feels obligated to take care of you. Those things are universal. Yeah.

264
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.680
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah. great points.

265
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:07.640
Michael Du: Yeah.

266
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.520
Michael Du: all right. So I think I think also like I'll recent questions. So basically

267
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:34.650
Michael Du: since your extensive experience in you know this impact, but also international kind of business, so like, I I guess, from your parrot priori experience. You have a lot of cases in like, you know, doing negotiations with different people

268
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:54.280
Michael Du: from with different cultural backgrounds. So like, what kind of strategy like have you found most effective? And also how do you like? By Dallas, the short term goals, and also with long term relationships. And maybe that's what I'm curious about you.

269
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.130
Justin: Yeah, Well, that's yeah, no, that's that's

270
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:07.540
Justin: I mean, that's a huge subject in and of itself right business development. I think I think you know the I would not consider myself like

271
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:15.080
Justin: pure Pd Guy. Well, you know I've done business development on and off for a large part of my career, and I I think that

272
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:28.640
Justin: you know I think there obviously it, when I was in dizzy much of the business development that deals that I was involved in more either distribution deals or licensing deals.

273
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:34.390
Justin: and that requires a real sort of

274
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:43.430
Justin: partner, mentality partner focus. and I think it. It's entirely consistent with my comments earlier about how you lead teams.

275
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:51.090
Justin: you know, taking. you know, one of the things I really enjoyed about, you know, being in a company like Disney. We had

276
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:59.110
Justin: literally. when I was running Disney consumer products in Japan. I had 350 licenses companies

277
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:06.750
Justin: that yeah, every year I would sign contract some with them with some of them multiple contracts per year.

278
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:15.720
Justin: and which means I had a great sales and in client management team. and they really, you know.

279
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:24.630
Justin: went through great pains to understand the different business objectives of the partners and try to sort of proactively

280
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:28.240
propose ways that they could leverage the Disney IP

281
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:41.550
Justin: to maximize their business objectives, and we would constantly discuss ways that we could partner, in order to maximize the the size of the business and super, serve the the end customers as best if we can.

282
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:55.300
Justin: which, in the case of Disney is really the lifeline of the company without without the fans there's there's no business. So so those type of deals the mentality when you go in and negotiate those deals

283
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.600
Justin: is one thing, and some of those deals tend to be

284
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:05.270
Justin: very long term relationships with large companies that extend over multiple years. But you.

285
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:21.380
Justin: you never less periodically renegotiate, renew deals. A lot of our our game deals would be multi year deals, but for consumer products. For example, most of our deals were one year deals with the auto renewals, but we had these

286
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:28.290
Justin: processes in place, for we we had what we used to call Jbp. Which is actually a Japan

287
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:41.940
Justin: Dizzy Japan developed process joint business planning. So we had an annual as if, like an annual budget in an internal organization, we had joint business plans with each of our key licenses.

288
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.420
Justin: and depending on the size of the the business with them.

289
00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:56.070
Justin: If If the the annual retail revenue generated by those businesses or the the royalties that Disney received in those businesses were at a certain level.

290
00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:02.710
Justin: Sometimes the business plans would be quarterly reviews, and depending on the size of the business.

291
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:14.380
Justin: you know the general manager of the division myself, for my directs would sit into each proposal. Sometimes they were done more at lower levels if they were smaller relationships. So it wasn't just

292
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.670
Justin: the negotiation of the deal, but it the maintenance of the relationship ongoing

293
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:37.150
Justin: in the game world. It's kind of like live ops, if you will, in a license business. That's very important. Now, when you talk about some of the the the the deals that you know, Over the past few years I've been, you know, to one degree or another involved in it. It's, scopely is

294
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:44.800
Justin: a lot of that has a more of a a in an investment component to it. So that was new for me.

295
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.280
Justin: and I learned a lot from

296
00:35:47.300 --> 00:36:01.180
Justin: the guys on in scope. We who are very good at that and corporate development, and you know, looking at different types of companies making different types of investments. And I think the mentality there. When you go into a deal and negotiation, it's.

297
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.240
Justin: If anything, it's, it's a more rigorous

298
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:25.410
Justin: process to get to a deal because you're you're talking about making significant capital outputs and and potentially acquiring companies right? And so that means bringing all of these talented folks into your your organization and being responsible for them ultimately in their careers. And again, as leaders.

299
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.370
Justin: Ultimately, when you're looking at a potential investment

300
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:37.420
Justin: and an acquisition, you're ultimately thinking, how do we incorporate these folks into our organization? Are they a fit?

301
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:46.270
Justin: And how could we, You know, post investment, post acquisition, maximize the the creative

302
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.540
Justin: and financial output

303
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:56.970
Justin: of that great right. So so the the mindset going into negotiations depends on the type of deal.

304
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:10.410
Justin: and then in terms of short versus long term. Again, it depends sometimes on the scale of the investment of the the size of the partnership. But just try to to try to give you a You know.

305
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:19.340
Justin: You know my specific style. I would say that i'm not the guy you see in in movies the tough guy Zeros, is

306
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:26.490
Justin: It's killed bang on the table. Yeah, yeah, out of that nonsense. I don't negotiate that way.

307
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:47.260
Justin: But I do think the first step. One thing I did I think I would like to mention. Here is the first step when you go into negotiation. There was a training course that we received back as at Disney, and there was a phrase that they, the the the the man who originated the whole program, came up with called back Not

308
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:59.460
Justin: and that acronym right. And I think some of you may be familiar with it, which is a you know, the best best alternative to a negotiated agreement.

309
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:10.350
Justin: So it's kind of like knowing if the deal doesn't happen, and you need to walk away. What are your other alternatives? So it's basically before you go into negotiation. I think

310
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:18.900
Justin: one of the key things is knowing what your leverage points are. having done the proper homework in advance, understanding

311
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:24.530
Justin: what leverage you could pull to get a negotiated agreement that makes sense for you

312
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:34.860
Justin: and what lines you shouldn't cross. And this is often a very much a data exercise. But financially saying, okay, to make this deal, make sense for us

313
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:38.740
Justin: here sort of parameters within which I need to keep.

314
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:48.090
Justin: And then, at the same time, when you go into those negotiations gradually, hopefully, if you're a good negotiator. You're starting to get a better understanding of the partners parameters

315
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.680
Justin: right? And and because it's, you know

316
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.950
Justin: it.

317
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.800
Justin: a deal is only going to be successful if both partners are successful. Ultimately.

318
00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.670
Justin: I've had details. By the way, I've I've done deals where

319
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.790
Justin: you know we were a little more successful than the partner was.

320
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:11.810
Justin: and what happens? There is those don't become long-term relationships.

321
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:24.450
Justin: And so you you know, if you're looking just to hey? I'm, i'm 5 million dollars short in the current forecast that I need to come up with a quick 5 million dollars. I need to do a quick deal.

322
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.500
Justin: That's one type of negotiation. But if you're looking to ultimately create

323
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.540
Justin: growth for multiple fiscal years and and something that that's going to become

324
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:54.330
Justin: meaningful for the company's bottom line, your negotiation approach is very different as well. So I I think it really depends. But going in my style was always been to like, Understand what my parameters were first, even before the first meeting or the first negotiation, and then spend much of the early negotiations, just trying to

325
00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:00.630
Justin: ask questions and understand where where the partners sort of sweet spot is

326
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.760
Justin: what they're what's gonna make it feel exciting for them?

327
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.320
Justin: And does that match with what we need?

328
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:12.660
Daniel Tedesco: Great do you do you think that approach worked

329
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:25.150
Daniel Tedesco: better or worse, depending on who was on the other side of the table? Because what you described is kind of what I was taught when I did. An Nba like that's that's the

330
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:36.830
Daniel Tedesco: kind of modern proper approach to negotiations. But I also wonder you know there are different styles. There are the bang on the table people, and

331
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.440
Daniel Tedesco: I don't know if

332
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:49.650
Daniel Tedesco: if you know the the the the proper thoughtful style is is always the best like, Where does it shine? Where does it fall down, or any

333
00:40:49.840 --> 00:41:00.630
Justin: specific examples? That's a tough question to answer. Because I I I i'm. I think it has more to do with what type of company you?

334
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.040
Justin: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like

335
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.060
Justin: I am. I've worked for 4 companies in my career.

336
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:19.080
Justin: and 85 to 90% of my thinking is influenced by Disney. and even today, and and that's

337
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:32.980
Justin: the the the leader I became was largely driven by my experiences in Disney and the leader I aspire to be is still driven largely by that. And so Disney has a certain way of doing things.

338
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:45.850
Justin: But even within Disney, depending on the division. It could be different. When I first joined Disney it was a bit different than what it became during the Bob Eiger era, which I think was

339
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:53.160
Justin: a very healthy place to be, and to learn. If you were a a an ambitious person.

340
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:57.850
Justin: because values and business results were always hand in hand.

341
00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:07.640
Justin: and what I learned most of them most of all is you can do both. Making being a nice person does not mean you're going to fail.

342
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:22.400
Justin: I I will name drop one person who no one watching this podcast may know, except Disney folks who will know very well a gentleman named Ben Pyne, and then was probably is probably one of the nicest guys who ever meet.

343
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:32.840
Justin: And Ben, for a long time was driving a lot of the negotiations for the most valuable properties of the Walt Disney Company, although you know they're cable channels.

344
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:43.050
Justin: you know Espn and the Disney Channel that, and he would go in and negotiate multi 1 billiondollar distribution deals with companies like Comcast and so forth, and

345
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:55.210
Justin: and created incredible value during his time at Disney for Disney, and Ben was the nicest guy you ever met, and you never heard a bad word about him. Even the people who negotiated with him, like like

346
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.730
Justin: most people are not

347
00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:10.630
Justin: that saintly, but but I will say that Ben was also a brilliant negotiator, who really understood his business and understood his levers and his parameters and and his bat not, and

348
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:17.180
Justin: he was one of many great mentors I was fortunate to have during my time, but you

349
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:28.790
Justin: can't underestimate the power of guys like that to get things done. So I I think, in other companies a different approach works very well, and and it really depends more on what?

350
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:38.230
Justin: Your organization as far as to be partially, maybe, also, which industry you're in like, as you know, dizzy Entertainment company.

351
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.190
Justin: very aspirational, brand. It's a brand. Everybody knows at the consumer level.

352
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.330
Justin: There's certain obligations that come with that and reputation, and

353
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.230
Justin: and and so forth. And so

354
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:54.520
Justin: I won't say all companies should do that or can do that. But it's my preference.

355
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.700
Michael Du: Okay.

356
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.930
Justin: yeah.

357
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.320
Michael Du: that's pretty insightful.

358
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:15.740
Michael Du: And now i'll probably can switch to switch the directly here. So so from like years of experience in Disney. So, looking ahead so W: what? What are the biggest opportunities or challenges

359
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:24.840
Michael Du: like, you see, maybe facing gaming or mobile industries like for particularly in Asia, and

360
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:36.120
Michael Du: and also like, how do you stay on top of the curve to you know, to so so that you can have always have the big pictures and also vision for the for the future.

361
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:43.650
Justin: Well, it well, those are 2 very big questions. I'll start with the second one, because I probably answer it quicker.

362
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.790
Justin: I mean, how do you? How do you stay on top? Is.

363
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:56.900
Justin: I would say. surround yourself and hang out with really smart people who can teach you stuff

364
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:11.360
Justin: and not just twitter like read stuff things things that people spend more than 5 min thinking about before they wrote.

365
00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.200
Justin: and and

366
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:23.040
Justin: and i'm reading a book right now. That is helping me think very differently about Web 3 and i'm still

367
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:38.080
Justin: trying to figure out like everybody. You know what web 3 will mean for companies in the next few years. But i'm i'm finding just going very old school and reading a book and spending a few hours thinking about nothing else at a time.

368
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.300
Justin: really helps.

369
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.240
Justin: But I think, in terms of trying to keep up with

370
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:50.670
Justin: where the industry is headed. One good thing about getting old, and there's there's not a lot

371
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:58.520
Justin: of good things about getting old, but one of the is. There is something to this this, you know, experience

372
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.110
Justin: leading to wisdom thing like

373
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:09.860
Justin: as is, you know, the market was about a year and a half 2 years ago, really making a lot of noise about web 3 and blockchain and crypto, and

374
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:18.360
Justin: it it just felt like the latest wave of something that has come before. But each wave is different. But you kind of understand

375
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:30.600
Justin: the psyche around early stage when these paradigm shifts happen, how that impacts different organizations and and what stages in its evolution are required.

376
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:40.530
Justin: not just for for technology to evolve and regulatory issues to be worked through, but also consumer adoption. And and you, just

377
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:50.610
Justin: when you get older you've already seen this. I saw one of these in the nineties, and then I saw one of these in the mid, You know. You know, around the a. SMS boom, the original phase of that. And so

378
00:46:50.720 --> 00:47:04.050
Justin: so you I see this is another wave and sort of the Internet's evolution and taking the time to read. to speak with people who understand it better than you do to really

379
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.720
Justin: not be afraid to lie, student

380
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:19.030
Justin: even one year in your fifties. So I would say that in terms of where the the the you know, the Asia is going, I think that was your other question.

381
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:38.940
Michael Du: I'm: sorry. So yeah, cause I I think recently I've been also cause yeah, I used to follow a lot of the you know trends and also trying to catch up, but recently also, like I, I I think, after my graduation, start to reading the books written by readal, you on principles.

382
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:58.510
Michael Du: and also some of his, his writings history. So like he was like. So so I was trying to say, like, yeah, it's really important to view the system for for like, how do you process the information and try to optimize your own human computer, to to try to

383
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:15.860
Justin: have a like a real align system, so that I can help you to grow like, and also evolve it at the same time. So so that's really important. Yeah, I I couldn't agree more. I think You're absolutely right like you. You You have to train your own brain and you

384
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:33.100
Justin: There's a degree of discipline required, because there's just a an exorbitant amount of noise. Anytime. A new technology evolves for a you know, a a new form of gaming or a new like. Few years ago everybody was talking about hyper casual, and there was some kind of

385
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:47.200
Justin: the chase after that, and i'm not knocking hyper casual. I'm just saying that you you. You need to be comfortable, I think sometimes with taking a step back and trying to see how all this fits together and build that skill into your

386
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:56.510
Justin: into your brain, and and how you spend your time that you know, having a little bit of discipline. So like, okay, i'm not going to spend any time on social media this afternoon, and we're gonna

387
00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.100
Justin: instead. I'm gonna, you know. Read a couple of articles on this particular, whatever it is.

388
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:06.110
Justin: and and go a little bit deeper there.

389
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:23.320
Justin: but you know it's a balance. I mean, there's a lot of value and a lot of knowledge. You can gleam off of social media, and and so I I just think it's a bit of a balance appetite or balance the diet. I should say you're consuming in terms of information.

390
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.400
Justin: and I think your other question was about like game industry trends, particularly in Asia, and where it's headed. Is that correct?

391
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.480
Michael Du: Yeah.

392
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:44.410
Justin: So I mean, I think I I think the the thing I always like to say up front and things like this is number one. Game is the now. The largest games are the largest form of entertainment in the planet.

393
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.490
Justin: And

394
00:49:45.520 --> 00:50:05.130
Justin: and a lot of us in the industry know that but very few people outside of the industry actually know that. And typically in the past, where you know TV and and films are just so core to the DNA of the culture. And you know, being in a company like in dis like Disney, where games is an ancillary business, even to this day.

395
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:22.310
Justin: in terms of its contribution to Ibida that it's hard for people sometimes to realize that games is significantly larger at this point than any other form of entertainment, and the growth rates on games are higher, so it's. It's actually pruding distance between itself and other forms of entertainment.

396
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:28.780
Justin: and within that Asia, obviously the largest region, the dominant region.

397
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:45.980
Justin: the most advanced region, the most technically and creatively dynamic industry, the the the the region with the most talent in the in in the industry for sure. And so

398
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:53.070
Justin: we should say that as people based in Asia on the apologetically and pride and proud. And I think that

399
00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.600
Justin: you know much of the change in the next few years, as has been the last 20 will be driven out of Asia.

400
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.180
Justin: So again, blockchain gaming.

401
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.910
Justin: artificial.

402
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.040
Justin: sure. A tremendous amount of innovation will come from other regions. But

403
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:16.710
Justin: I think in in gaming in particular, Asia will continue to lead. I do think it's important

404
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.810
Justin: to

405
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.340
Justin: also point out what you guys know, which is that there is no one Asia.

406
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:36.160
Justin: And then. even when I'm. Strategically trying to segment the region for the purposes of budgeting and strategic planning, I would say at this point, I view basically there's 4

407
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.310
Justin: parts to Asia, if you will. There's China which is just

408
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:51.420
Justin: China is standalone like you have to view China uniquely because of both the fact that it's the largest gaming market in the planet.

409
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:57.170
Justin: The fact that it has the most talented workforce in the world for gaming.

410
00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:10.420
Justin: but also the fact that it's a heavily regulated market. That's not particularly friendly to foreign companies. Companies. From a publishing standpoint it's heavily restricted, and

411
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:22.850
Justin: but so so there are much of, or a lot of, the innovation that we've seen in the last few years in particular, and free to play has come out of China, and there's just a a massive amount of talent.

412
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.630
Justin: and that's not changing. So

413
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:33.570
Justin: I I I China comes with a lot of questions. If you're not a Chinese company about how to do business effectively there.

414
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:42.110
Justin: But you cannot deny the importance of China as a consumer market, and certainly as as a producer and export of content.

415
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:55.270
Justin: The second bucket, I would say, is advanced, or, let's say, mature markets in Asia, which I put Japan at the top of the list, and Korea a close second, just because it's smaller

416
00:52:55.370 --> 00:53:03.340
Justin: on in Japan. You know. I like to point this out, you know, if you just talk about mobile gaming Japan and Korea combined

417
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.230
Justin: is on an absolute basis bigger than the United States.

418
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:15.100
Justin: Despite the fact, despite the fact that the populations, even when you combine them is still only half the population of the Us.

419
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:25.590
Justin: That's how big gaming is ingrained in the in the culture in these 2 countries, and a tremendous amount of innovation still comes out of Korea.

420
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:42.020
Justin: Korea, the birthplace of free to play gaming argument. And Japan the leader, you know, the first Major Asian country to get into gaming in a meaningful way, and still incredibly important, the number 3 gaming mark in the world

421
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:52.410
Justin: home of Sony and Nintendo, and excluding the us probably the single biggest generator of high value, IP in the world for gaming.

422
00:53:52.520 --> 00:54:04.660
Justin: And so Japan and Korea. and also, you know, high yield consumer mark. It's very sophisticated consumers. We spend a lot in gaming and our experts and gave me like in China.

423
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:15.440
Justin: so I would say, China, the mature markets and the emerging markets when you the third bucket Southeast Asia in particular. And what's interesting about South East Asia is. among other things.

424
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:25.760
Justin: it's a very young population, and they're really leading the way in the numer. The newer forms of gaming, such as esports.

425
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:32.570
Justin: blockchain, and I think in the next few years

426
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:40.810
Justin: Southeast Asia will become a region that global or globally as aspiring companies will pay more attention to.

427
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:46.450
Justin: But you know, there's a lot of challenges still in in distributing games in South East Asia because of payment.

428
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:53.260
you know, obviously different language, different cultures, different regulatory environments, and so forth.

429
00:54:53.310 --> 00:55:00.260
Justin: But the innovation blockchain gaming is really, you know, been dri driven a large part out of that part of the world. So

430
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:09.290
Justin: and then the fourth bucket is India, which, like China, for very obvious reasons you should look at as its own region.

431
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:16.390
Justin: and I can see, is the consumer market not as interesting yet as as the other 3, because it's not as big yet.

432
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:21.050
Daniel Tedesco: but ultimately it may be the region well along with Japan.

433
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:32.660
Justin: It has the most local content, and and over time a healthy sort of local studio ecosystem. I think today Indian studios are just

434
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.040
Justin: starting to show potential

435
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:49.140
Justin: to be globally competitive. I don't think they're there yet, but there's a lot of positive growth happening in India, not just at the consumer level, but at the at the developer level. So it's it's one to watch.

436
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.530
Michael Du: Great

437
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:59.230
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah, for sure. That's a broad

438
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:03.580
Daniel Tedesco: review. But I think a good summary of the the Diversity

439
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:08.850
Daniel Tedesco: across a pack. And there there are other markets that

440
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:21.510
Daniel Tedesco: you know the those buckets don't even mention, like Taiwan, is the what the fifth or sixth largest gay market in the world, and it's really, I I would definitely say, like

441
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.110
Justin: I, I sort of tend to group Hong, Kong, Taiwan.

442
00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:42.080
Justin: Australia, and New Zealand along with like Japan creates like the mature gaming markets. You know that sophisticated yeah, I because it's small. I didn't mention Taiwan, but it certainly is one of the mature markets. I've small population, but

443
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.400
Justin: highly sophisticated hierarchy gaming market.

444
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.380
Justin: all right.

445
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.390
Justin: and I wouldn't. I don't lump it in

446
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:55.800
Justin: with emerging markets at all. Actually, I think in time one is far more advanced than that

447
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:56.880
Michael Du: for sure.

448
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.980
Justin: Yeah.

449
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:09.570
Justin: Well, then, the first bucket has to be called mainland China. So we don't get cancelled well and and and there's just the fundamental difference in distribution that you know

450
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:17.810
Justin: the very fact that there's no global play versus Google play being very healthy in Taiwan and Hong Kong. That will only

451
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.740
Justin: definitely.

452
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:27.790
Justin: and the consumer preferences from that really different. So so from mainland to Taiwan, for example.

453
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.900
Justin: So

454
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.910
Justin: I just think that they certainly

455
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:37.210
Justin: a Taiwan, for sure, in Hong Kong for sure within the mature markets bucket in my mind.

456
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.190
Daniel Tedesco: Right? Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.550
Daniel Tedesco: So what's

458
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.840
Daniel Tedesco: talk a little bit about some of the

459
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:50.160
Daniel Tedesco: ips? Because I think some of the the

460
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.970
Daniel Tedesco: game ips, and particularly that you

461
00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:08.700
Daniel Tedesco: worked with most closely, are actually really unique to Asia. I'm thinking of like kingdom hearts and some some, I guess, even more particularly to Japan itself.

462
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:09.840
Daniel Tedesco: And

463
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:13.880
Daniel Tedesco: probably when when you first started interacting with those

464
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:18.980
Daniel Tedesco: ips or or potential ips, you know it.

465
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:24.150
Daniel Tedesco: If if you If you had pitched those to me 10 years ago.

466
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:35.730
Daniel Tedesco: I I would have thought this doesn't make any sense like Why why is Why is goofy in an in, you know, an an Rpg. Game battling monsters.

467
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:51.120
Daniel Tedesco: And you know, why is Disney making a digital Beanie babies? But you know those have been incredible successes, both

468
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:56.110
Daniel Tedesco: financially, but also in terms of kind of

469
00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:03.140
Daniel Tedesco: creatively, you know, kingdom hearts is a is a beloved IP.

470
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.210
Daniel Tedesco: So

471
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:19.390
Daniel Tedesco: yeah, if if you know you can share any of the the the stories behind how those those came about. But also you know how. How do you find the opportunities like that when there is probably a sea of of options.

472
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:28.940
Justin: Well, yeah, I mean I've I the one of the many pleasures I I I had of being My position in Disney was that

473
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:46.170
Justin: you know we were given a great deal of empowerment from the headquarters to you know, understanding that Asia, gaming and age is at another level in terms of the scale, and also the creative talent. Of course, the different territories from so

474
00:59:46.170 --> 01:00:05.890
Justin: Disney was smart enough to know that there's great developers in Japan, in China, in Korea that could help interpret our our IP. Which is already very strong in all those countries. Of course, thanks to the films and theme parks and consumer products and television. And now Disney plus, and you know, but

475
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:12.790
Justin: you know how local talent, local creative town. Local technical talent could

476
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:19.020
Justin: help interpret our IP and put it into that form of entertainment gaming.

477
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:38.650
Justin: And I, you know I really respect that our leadership in La knew enough to know that that was something that would elevate the brand in in certain cases. And you know we we always needed to have a rigorous creative process to get to a decision whether to do a game or not, just like we have

478
01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:43.370
Justin: the same process in the West, but being open to the idea that

479
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.260
Justin: the characters could

480
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:55.640
Justin: expand, and what they do, and who they are in these worlds, that that it's not just derivative content, but in some sense it involves the stores, and sometimes we create new characters, like, in the case of kingdom, hearts

481
01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.380
Justin: first and foremost, something like kingdom hearts. It's important to say, up front that

482
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:17.010
Justin: kingdom hearts is not kingdom hearts without Square Edx. I mean Square Andx is a fabulous creative organization in a technical or innovative organization and the partnership to sort of harken back to the our conversation a little bit earlier is like

483
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:24.740
Justin: that was built, and and and the relationship with Square Nixon. Disney has evolved over 20 years now.

484
01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:33.610
Justin: and it literally started 3, 4 years before I even joined Disney, so I can't take credit for starting kingdom arts. I did not.

485
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:39.210
Justin: The 2 people who started kingdom hearts, one in school and one in Disney.

486
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:59.290
Justin: It just so happened that the shared an elevator ride, and they were in the same office building Disney and Square. This was before square in it's when it was still we're in the same elevator, and they just struck up a conversation, and it led to some brainstorming, some more detail conversations

487
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:11.220
Justin: going that La and Burbank to make the pitch. It was not always well received internally in Disney. It took a while to get people to understand why the game division felt working with

488
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:23.150
Justin: Square at the time and square in it thereafter on you know the the makers of final fantasy. Why, Disney, partnering with them and and mashing up characters and creating new characters in this world.

489
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:31.380
Justin: Why, how we could make it from a brand perspective, make sense and make it compelling game. The in the creative output and

490
01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:43.790
Justin: creative output over multiple games and platforms over the years a lot of talented people have contributed to it, and I had the honor of on the Disney side of managing the franchise for a decade

491
01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:58.590
Justin: so, and I came in. There was a big low in the franchise there was there, you know. It was 5 years since King of March. 2 had come out, and it was really not. There was a couple of smaller like handheld titles, but there was no roadmap for the future.

492
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:08.770
Justin: and I thought that odd and and as I got my head around the business and got to know the CEO would square in, except time what less on, and then

493
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:15.650
Justin: the current CEO of us on. After that we able to negotiate multiple new deals.

494
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:28.800
Justin: kingdom hearts taking the back catalog and and up resing them for playstation, 4 and and Xbox launching a mobile title and all tie into and leading to Kingdom Hearts 3,

495
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:37.850
Justin: which was shipped in 2,019. So he was a highlight of my career to be involved in that franchise, and to get to be in the room with a lot of the

496
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.710
Justin: creative sessions between

497
01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:47.480
Justin: director in in La and up at Pixar, with

498
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.250
Justin: the brand owners of frozen and thinking, Wow

499
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:54.960
Justin: and toy story and monster zinc, and

500
01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:04.590
Justin: being sitting in the room in those offices in California while they were working on script and and scenarios, and and

501
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.580
Justin: just getting people coffee and staying out of the way of the

502
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:23.170
Justin: I try not to hurt myself. That's a career highlight for me. And then soon, soon, and a lot of folks don't know, since some outside of Japan. But it's actually the biggest, most successful game on any platform in the history of the Walt Disney Company in terms of financial

503
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.330
Justin: performance, and

504
01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:39.200
Justin: it's a massive, massive hit. It's been in the market now 9 years. still consistently in top 10 grossing in Japan. the largest, the most downloaded game app in the history of the app store in Japan

505
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:57.610
Justin: to this day the largest dau of any game in Japan. Even today, after 9 years massive hit, and that came out of conversation. That one. I was there on day one because it was a phone call between me and the head of the Disney Store, Japan, and we came up.

506
01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.180
Justin: He was working on this plush, and he showed me, and I thought it would make a good game. And then

507
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.960
Justin: I have some really talented team members in Disney Japan who really worked with

508
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:18.780
Justin: our partners at line to come up with the con seat and to prototype and selling that into Burbank was actually less challenging than kingdom hearts, because

509
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:25.650
Justin: we're all already committed to the consumer product. Line the the the plushes. and so call me up with a game

510
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:46.490
Justin: seemed additive strategically, but ultimately the game proves to be the real driver of the franchise, and so much so that eventually we rolled out consumer products, I think, across like 20 or 30 different licenses in Japan, and they started selling the merchandise globally, and all the parks, including in Shanghai and Hong Kong and

511
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.740
Justin: and Florida and La and Paris.

512
01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.790
Justin: and

513
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:55.610
Justin: and they've created animation shorts for the Disney Channel based on it.

514
01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:00.100
Justin: and that all came out of like a phone call in

515
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:10.380
Justin: in Mexico, Tokyo in 2,013, I think. And you're talking about a multi 1 billiondollar franchise created

516
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:14.220
Justin: out of Japan. So

517
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:26.400
Justin: a company like Disney being able to do that, it was a great honor to be allowed to be part of that. Even now in my neighborhood. People sort of tease me about that game, because everybody

518
01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:30.720
Justin: please, that came, and no I I was a associated with it for a long time, so

519
01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:35.890
Justin: they they they like to come and and and my kids

520
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:40.630
Justin: French all call me. It's in the papa.

521
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:47.610
Justin: maybe just Justin's too hard a name for them to remember. But Simpson, they can remember

522
01:06:47.610 --> 01:07:05.090
Justin: right. Okay, maybe maybe we'll change the title of this video to interview with so much of a pop up. I mean it. It shows the power of a good idea, because so many people limited to it. The partners, our employees

523
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:12.900
Justin: employees, not just in the Core team in Tokyo. But then folks in the Us. Folks around the region, and then, you know, I left

524
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.200
Justin: Disney about 4 years ago.

525
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:25.440
Justin: and you know Kingdom hearts where they're working on right now, and zoom is still a top, you know. When you create great IP, it's more important than any exact, any any individual.

526
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.050
Justin: and it just

527
01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:33.930
Justin: it just continues to be popular even when you change creatively. Sometimes it it's done in the right way.

528
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:41.000
Justin: and so successful franchises. Ips are just invaluable, and in in gaming industry it's the same thing.

529
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.360
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah. Well, then, go and

530
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:52.670
Daniel Tedesco: back to. I guess the the last part of the question. You probably saw lots of ideas like like those

531
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:57.280
Daniel Tedesco: come through as as potentials.

532
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:06.270
Daniel Tedesco: You know. How how did you decide? How how do you decide which ones to and invest in versus not.

533
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:14.940
Daniel Tedesco: And I guess any any cases where where it didn't. You know where it wasn't the the the big success? And how do you learn from those?

534
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:30.500
Justin: Yeah. So so there were cases where we failed, and we don't talk about those. You know one of the things that that, I think, is a prerequisite to having a successful new IP or a new game or something it's like

535
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:43.399
Justin: in a case of Simpson. We knew we wanted to create a game with line, because we had already, you know, the the the messaging app line, just the the default. It's the we chat of Japan right, and and

536
01:08:43.399 --> 01:09:01.640
Justin: I had spent time with their CEO understood their business strategy again to call back during the conversation. We already been in business together, because Disney helped line launch their stamped business, which is a very lucrative business here, selling all types of emoji and stamps online in Japan.

537
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:17.800
Justin: I know another Asian property, and, like we chat and doesn't, monetize well. But in Japan even today monetize very well. We already had a a business relationship with Line and Disney, but we we knew that we wanted to something bigger in the game space.

538
01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:22.229
Justin: and we just had that that moment where

539
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:35.180
Justin: I saw these pluses, that the Disney store. Japan had originally developed. and it 10. It was based on the sort of a Buddhist something you see it Buddhist temples of stacking stones.

540
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:47.170
Justin: but instead of the idea of of cute Disney pluses, and I said, Well, that's got it. That's a good idea for a casual game, and we wanted to create a casual game, because we thought the line audience would be very

541
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:59.350
Justin: mass audience, not just gamers. So it had to be a very simple game plan. and we knew we had great style guides from the Disney store, and we could build upon that in 2D art for for gaming.

542
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.960
Justin: and we should just took it from there

543
01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:17.010
Justin: with kingdom hearts, I mean. It was pretty obvious. The makers of final fantasy were also Disney lovers and efficient autos, and they had a story for a very compelling story that they pitched to Disney, and and of how we can make it all work

544
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:20.580
Justin: so it's it's very case back is, I give it one more example

545
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:25.380
Justin: in Japan for years. The Ital game genre is very popular, very steady.

546
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:31.390
Justin: you know. I/O games for for predominantly male audiences, idle games for predominantly female audiences.

547
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:44.520
Justin: And I there was a time I I I challenge my team in Tokyo. We had already had kingdom hearts. And since, when I said okay, I want to go into the idle genre, I think it's Disney can absolutely create original IP

548
01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:52.100
Justin: in the idle genre. go out to some partners. Come up with your own ideas and and let's do a pitch process. And we did it.

549
01:10:52.290 --> 01:11:02.380
Justin: And eventually the idea that we arrived at became a game called Disney Twisted Wonderland, and that Disney Twisted Wonderland is an idle game in Japan.

550
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:06.460
Justin: A Disney branded all original characters.

551
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:15.470
Justin: but based on, and with very strong callbacks to a lot of the the traditional Disney stories.

552
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:21.360
Justin: and takes place in a university in this sort of alternative universe.

553
01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:22.690
Justin: and

554
01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:35.250
Justin: that game is between, you know. Top 10 top, 20 grossing game in Japan for 3 years now, and the your story was written by a Japanese manga artist

555
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:54.570
Justin: who had already had some hits, ironically doing some work with Square Edx not related to Kay parts, and she was also conveniently a huge Disney fan and aficionado. And so they worked on this whole con seat of what became called Night Raid in college.

556
01:11:54.570 --> 01:12:02.340
Justin: which is where the the story takes place. and this game to this day is a a top Popular damage. Pan.

557
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:11.540
Justin: The publishers aniplex, who was great, you know the same guys to do fate grand grand order. So we knew, working with a company that knew what they were doing.

558
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.040
Justin: And

559
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:32.500
Justin: you know that was an example of the team internally. And this is Japan, figuring out how to work with a potentially great partner and a and a great writer, a creative mind externally bringing them in, mashing it up with some of the intern internal ideas, and evolving into a 15 to 20 milliondollars a month game.

560
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.380
Justin: And you know that persistently does. Well.

561
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:43.950
Justin: so. But you know. Then, you know, inevitably, we make mistakes by trying to repeat what we did before.

562
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:53.920
Justin: and you get diminishing returns right? So so you always kind of feel. Oh, this one's feel special. This one feels a little different

563
01:12:53.930 --> 01:13:08.270
Justin: when you're doing something that you're uncomfortable like that's new. And with twisted wonderland which launched after I left Disney it was in development while I was in Disney. We did the deal while I was there, but I left in sort of mid development.

564
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:17.470
Justin: and when it launched I just by the time it launched I was excited just to see where it landed creatively, and then, obviously, I knew it was going to be popular, because it

565
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.030
Justin: the passion behind it and the talent, but behind it.

566
01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:27.650
Justin: and and to the credit of the team and the partner I mean it exceeded my expectations. Wow!

567
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:29.840
Daniel Tedesco: So it sounds like with

568
01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.150
Daniel Tedesco: with each of these

569
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:35.310
Daniel Tedesco: 3 examples in particular. At least

570
01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:49.080
Daniel Tedesco: it wasn't it wasn't like there was just a kind of a a pitch out of nowhere with a great idea. There were. There were kind of things that stacked up on top of each other

571
01:13:49.310 --> 01:14:03.460
Daniel Tedesco: like, you know, there was this relationship with line that you wanted to build a casual game. There were already the the the some plushies in the stores.

572
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:06.990
Daniel Tedesco: You know you saw kind of the the

573
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:26.760
Daniel Tedesco: kind of a a cultural connection with the stacking things that at temples, and that is what brought it together. It wasn't just a a an idea like a a perfect idea out of the ether it it's like you're connecting things that already kind of sprouting.

574
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:42.750
Justin: and in case of gaming, knowing that they're in genres that consumers like and are comfortable with, like Rpg: it twisted one or any idle genre, You know Simpson again, a varying of a match, 3 type of puzzle game things, you know, big with big audiences.

575
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:47.650
Justin: Another example is in Korea with net marvel. We did marvel future fight. It was the same kind of

576
01:14:47.910 --> 01:15:06.380
Justin: it is sort of that sort of genre action. Rpg: that it was. They were very good already net marvel. They had proven expertise in the genre, huge passion for the marble brand and the studio that developed the game. The the net model studio called Monster Studio.

577
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:22.150
Justin: Their Gms. Ken Kim is just a creative. He's he's a rock star, and so that Ken was pitching us the ideas. It was just yeah, I want to make some of this guy, and he became so trusted not only by my team, but marvel in the Us.

578
01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:28.870
Justin: That they allowed Can and his team to create several original characters in marvel future fight. That then

579
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:37.230
Justin: original marvel characters that you know, made in Korea, that eventually became even in corporate into some of the Us. Comics.

580
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:47.480
Justin: so that they're actually part of the global marvel character database now and and are used from time to time. And in some of the non gaming areas of the the business.

581
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.550
Justin: That's when you know when you know you have great

582
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.800
Justin: creative people on the other side of the table.

583
01:15:53.010 --> 01:16:00.340
Justin: You're in pretty shape. It's not it doesn't always work out that way, and sometimes you want something a little too much, and you force it.

584
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.810
Justin: But things go well. There's usually a really great

585
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:06.730
Justin: creative person behind it.

586
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.820
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah. And that example actually makes me think of

587
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.880
Daniel Tedesco: something else. You know, there, there's this term reverse innovation, which is.

588
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:25.610
Daniel Tedesco: I think, pretty eurocentric and and kind of racist too.

589
01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.130
Daniel Tedesco: But

590
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:36.470
Daniel Tedesco: you know there that it encapsulates this idea that there could be a trend of oh, well, you know, there's

591
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:45.690
Daniel Tedesco: now there's things happening in emerging markets that can be applied to other developed markets.

592
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:46.960
Daniel Tedesco: and

593
01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:53.180
Daniel Tedesco: you know typically the the term is used when talking about like oh, you know.

594
01:16:53.390 --> 01:17:00.180
Justin: Alibaba supply chains like, what can the the Us. Learn about them?

595
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:07.420
Daniel Tedesco: But the games? I think a lot of the games are so unique that that you've had the

596
01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.370
Daniel Tedesco: that you've been able to to work with like

597
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:23.090
Daniel Tedesco: some some, and you tw twisted university. It's like there. There's probably a a rich vein of potential to figuring out. Well, how could these types of

598
01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:33.080
Daniel Tedesco: dynamics, either, you know, characters or art styles or stories, gameplay mechanics that can be applied in in other parts of the world.

599
01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:45.070
Justin: I had that question posed to me a lot like in in in Disney, they would say, like, Why do you think this scheme doesn't work as well in the West? Or why does this Western game not work as well, and

600
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:57.360
Justin: in Asia, or something like that. And sometimes it just is what it is like You You it's not through a lack of effort or or innovation necessarily. But you know, consumer preferences do vary.

601
01:17:57.370 --> 01:18:00.620
Justin: Yeah, and you know that's

602
01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:07.820
Justin: why you have to be somewhat cognizant of that when you're making games.

603
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:20.490
Justin: And and you know this is a business. So when you're thinking about where to to place your bats and where to make your investments, you have to obviously have a degree of confidence that you're going to reach a big enough audience with what you're creating

604
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:27.290
Justin: and that's going to be relevant to a big enough audience that you'll get that return on investment. right? Yeah. But

605
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:35.180
Justin: but what I would reiterate is that at the end of the day the Asia markets are the largest ones in

606
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.870
Justin: today, and

607
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:45.950
Justin: putting more and more distance between themselves and other regions. So you know, if you're in a Western company, the problem is

608
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.700
Justin: you somewhat.

609
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:55.600
Justin: I think you have a little bit of a unconscious bias that you assume. If you're in the Us. You're in the biggest market, and you, you know.

610
01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.950
Justin: in the case of films, that's true

611
01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:12.440
Justin: case of television. That's true. In the case of theme parts, that's true. But in the case of games. That's just not factually correct. So you know there the the thing that was impressive about Disney

612
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.680
Justin: and one of you know many of the bosses I had that were really impressive. One of them was a guy named Jimmy Pittaro.

613
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:33.680
Justin: and Jimmy now runs. He's the chairman of Espn, but at the time he was the head of consumer products and an interactive media, and Jimmy understood that like soon. Soon, you know it's the biggest game in the Wall Company, the Walt Disney company's history.

614
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:37.900
Justin: 95% of the revenue lifetime that will make is made in Japan

615
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.540
Justin: 95%, and is the biggest game in the country to the company's history because the markets, the industry is that big.

616
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:49.620
Justin: And but there's that many games that you know you.

617
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.900
Justin: It's not like

618
01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.290
Justin: compared to films. There's infinitely more games out there that are live services in operations today

619
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.120
Justin: that are generating meaningful revenue for years.

620
01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.240
Justin: And so you, Your competition is such that you.

621
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:16.730
Justin: You can't necessarily insist that we're going to make one game. It's going to be a big hit everywhere in the world, and we'll get economies of scale, and it sounds really good for Mbas and all that like, but that's not what the consumers want.

622
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:22.410
Justin: And so there are games that have scaled across region. There are examples of that. And so the problem is that

623
01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:32.510
Justin: the exceptions become what people point to when the overwhelming majority of games today, up until this point, I believe, into the future will monetize in certain regions better than others.

624
01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:37.120
Justin: and that there's nothing wrong with it. If you look at what

625
01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.090
Justin: see arena down to the free.

626
01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.650
Justin: It's brilliant.

627
01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:54.120
Justin: It's absolutely brilliant. How they decide we're going to focus on emerging markets and super serve the end customers, because we understand the circumstances that they have when they're experiencing our game

628
01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:59.100
Justin: network limitations, handset limitations, payment needs

629
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:06.690
Justin: how they access content. You know how they are willing to pay for things micro payments that nature

630
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:15.540
Justin: they just do it. And and and you know, being on the calendars, the social calendars, those regions, launching events

631
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:19.500
Justin: consistent with those parts of the world, and prioritizing that

632
01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:24.250
Justin: they just went in and found a huge and growing

633
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:35.000
Justin: a part of the gaming industry that's largely uncontested right now, and they just went in and in in in the first person. Shooter Genre went in and just took it over

634
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:41.120
Justin: and own it and do it better than anybody, and I really respect that focus. And

635
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.790
Justin: yeah. there's other companies that have scaled really well, globally with a few titles. But

636
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.000
Justin: I I think most companies tend to be strong in one region or another.

637
01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.090
Daniel Tedesco: Right? Yeah.

638
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.940
Justin: But the pie is so big

639
01:21:56.310 --> 01:22:07.190
Justin: I don't necessarily think that's there's yeah. Oh, unless we're strong in all markets, there's an issue I I really the more i'm at this business, the more I question that.

640
01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.450
Justin: Yeah.

641
01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.270
Daniel Tedesco: right?

642
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:12.750
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah. Well, I mean

643
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:22.520
Justin: as some some proves like Japan, Japan alone can be enough. Look at, Look at, look at you know, as proud as i'm at, since you look at honor of kings.

644
01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.530
Justin: Yeah, or China alone.

645
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:31.150
Justin: right? That they like out of things is not a big game in the Western world like right?

646
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:36.460
Justin: No, it doesn't need to be.

647
01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.980
Justin: Look at how big the lineage franchises in Asia.

648
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.300
Justin: Right?

649
01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.700
Justin: Massive, right? It's not that way in the West, but you know

650
01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:58.460
Justin: over multiple titles. Now, over multiple decades. Lineage is just a massive franchise. And so I think I think you have to look at it in that contacts

651
01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:10.700
Justin: there's in Japan. We have a lot of the top grossing games in mobile or games that don't export at all like monsters like your fake, grand order, or puzzles and dragons.

652
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.500
Justin: you know.

653
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:17.720
Justin: puzzles and dragons is 10 years old and still monetize incredibly. Well.

654
01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:25.550
Justin: you see the TV commercials all the time. Yeah, in grossing game it is over 10 years old. Yeah.

655
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:27.170
Justin: So

656
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:33.800
Justin: yeah, but that game is not making money anywhere else. And still it's a very healthy business for

657
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:36.140
Justin: who is the company that it runs that game.

658
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:40.170
Justin: So yeah, I I think you have to.

659
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:46.840
Justin: If you're a game publisher or game developer being particularly strong in one region or another is not necessarily a bad thing.

660
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:47.690
Daniel Tedesco: Right?

661
01:23:48.310 --> 01:24:01.360
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah, those are some incredible examples. Just as as we start to wrap up. Is there anything that we didn't cover for the audience that you'd think we should.

662
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.940
Justin: Gee!

663
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:10.430
Justin: What a lot of fun! And and what I would say is

664
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:21.590
Justin: for those people who are watching that are in the gaming industry, you know. Be very proud. Be very excited. Change is is a given, and there's a lot of change right now, be it, you know.

665
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:24.120
Justin: sort of the increase sort of

666
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:32.640
Justin: A/C acceleration towards a multi platform, and you know the somewhat inevitability of web 3. And and

667
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:36.720
Justin: you know, as business models continue to become

668
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:43.770
Justin: diversified. There's, you know, always questions, always things to give you stress

669
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.110
Justin: things to figure out.

670
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:52.050
Justin: But me personally, I find it very exciting, and the one thing that never changes that

671
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:54.390
Justin: we're in the entertainment business.

672
01:24:55.410 --> 01:25:00.450
Justin: To me games are entertainment, you know. We talk when you talk about the game industry.

673
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:08.280
Justin: Yeah. You can talk about everything, from the venture capitalist to the streamers, to the influencers, to the live Ops

674
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:15.190
Justin: publishers Apple Google, all of these important components of the ecosystem.

675
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:23.190
Justin: But at the end of the day none of it matters. If it's not serving the customer. The customer is why everything else exists

676
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:42.150
Justin: so, whether it's blockchain, or if it's multi platform, or if it's traditional free to play, or if it's, console whatever the genre or the platform. You know the IP. All of those things are really important, and figuring all that out is the difference between being successful and not

677
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:49.500
Justin: but all the things you're doing is still you're doing it for for the customer. So

678
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:57.710
Justin: the one old man, sage pseudo, sage word of advice that says, never lose sight of the customer

679
01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:04.920
Justin: because technology is going to change it's going to be web 4 at some point. They gotta figure out

680
01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:17.360
Justin: AI is gonna dramatically impact what we do. And you guys had a great podcast recently on that. And you know, Jenner AI is another area that anybody in gaming needs to be paying attention to. But ultimately

681
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:23.150
Justin: all of this, the cool tools and the technologies again, are all about, you know, improving

682
01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:30.270
Justin: ultimately the quality of the output to the consumer. right? And if you you keep that as your North star.

683
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:36.520
Justin: you'll probably have enough successes that you can stay in the industry and hopefully make some money.

684
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:37.760
Daniel Tedesco: Yeah?

685
01:26:37.930 --> 01:26:44.910
Daniel Tedesco: Well, that is inspiring. No, to end on. Michael. Did you have something to?

686
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:48.150
Michael Du: No, I think that that's great. Yeah.

687
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:50.580
Daniel Tedesco: yeah.

688
01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:56.900
Daniel Tedesco: Justin. So how should folks follow? You learn more about your up to what you're up to?

689
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:58.910
Justin: Well.

690
01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:09.370
Justin: you know I have I I would i'm a little old school. I'm not a big Twitter guy, but I tend to weigh in on what i'm thinking on linkedin

691
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:12.680
Justin: more and more these days, because

692
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:30.680
Justin: obviously a lot of you know it's a but a bit more of a focused adult conversation around gaming and other technology topics. So I tend to do most of my communication on linkedin anybody who wants to seize this and wants to reach out to me on Linkedin, happy to have a chat, and

693
01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.740
Justin: increasingly i'm sort of putting my thoughts on Linkedin as well about where the industry is headed. But

694
01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:44.650
Justin: I i'm as interested to meet other folks, too. So anybody who wants to reach out please do so like I said, we're always

695
01:27:44.710 --> 01:27:47.620
Justin: trying to learn new things here. So at least I am.

696
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:54.040
Justin: Yeah, I would say like in for sure, and I like personal conversations, so just
